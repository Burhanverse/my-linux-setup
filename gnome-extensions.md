### Extensions that I use on Fedora (GNOME)
---
You might need [Extension Manager](https://flathub.org/apps/com.mattjakeman.ExtensionManager) for better management of the extensions.

- [AppIndicator and KstatusNotifier](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support): Adds AppIndicator, KStatusNotifierItem and legacy Tray icons support to the Shell

- [Dash to Dock](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/307/dash-to-dock): A dock for the Gnome Shell. This extension moves the dash out of the overview transforming it in a dock for an easier launching of applications and a faster switching between windows and desktops. Side and bottom placement options are available.

- [GSConnect](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1319/gsconnect/): GSConnect is a complete implementation of KDE Connect especially for GNOME Shell with Nautilus, Chrome and Firefox integration. It does not rely on the KDE Connect desktop application and will not work with it installed.
